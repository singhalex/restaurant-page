This project was an assignment for The Odin Project. The goal of the assignment was to learn how to use web pack to bundle various files and create a single page site built from javascript.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- webpack

## Live Site
[Le Jardin des Delices](https://singhalex.github.io/restaurant-page/)

## How it Works
This is a single page website. Each 'page' is built in a seperate JavaScript module. These modules build the relevant elements and attach them to the main body. Event listeners are added to the links in the nav bar that clear the body content and build the associated 'page'.
